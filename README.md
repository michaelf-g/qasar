I have made the API assigment implementation very simple and linked it to an example bank which I decided to call Qasar Bank

Qasar bank owns an API that exposes 2 endpoints 

I have made the server side API endpoint exposure as well as the client side API implementation, more details on source code readme.txt file

A simple gui where you can request to create an account via and/or view account details and transactions
